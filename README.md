## üÜò The Problem

In India, Thalassemia patients and their families face a constant, frantic search for blood. They are forced to rely on scattered WhatsApp messages and countless phone calls, creating immense stress and dangerous delays in life-saving treatment. The system is reactive, inefficient, and places an unfair burden on those who are already suffering.
